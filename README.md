# Oorja

Every two minutes, the energy reaching the earth from the sun is equivalent to the whole annual usage of humanity.. think about it for a moment all the energy, all the AC, all the cars of the world in a year is equal to just 2 minutes of the sun.
Does that change how you think about energy???

In AKTU we had a compulsory internship subject where we had to make something out of microprocessors. and I had no clue what to make. I aspire to a mechatronics engineer one day but at that moment I was clueless!!! ever since my childhood I was deeply in love with energy so I decided and here we are, my paper and project Oorja: a real-time sustainable power monitoring system.

It is a revolutionary solution designed to enhance energy efﬁciency in various industries as well as commercial properties. It provides real-time monitoring and analysis of power consumption, enabling businesses and households to optimize their energy usage and reduce costs.

The Project has gone through multiple versions to reach at a level it is right now.

History:
> Originally in version 1, Oorja was designed as a part of my Internship project and was an energy measuring device using Bluetooth module and Arduino UNO. It was limited in range and the sensor it used was primary and didn't provide accurate readings

> In version 2, I upgraded it to use ESP32 instead of Arduino and used a better PZEM-004T sensor which is better, more accurate and energy efficient. It is no longer limited in range as it is IOT enabled. This was the version that got selected to be published in IEEE Xplore.

Progress:
> Currently, Oorja is in its Third version of making. I am trying to integrate AI in its core feature, as a part of SIH, using EmbeddeML in order to enable Oorja to provide personalised suggestions to save energy when it recognises your pattern using its metering capabilities and other sensors which senses the environment around it.
