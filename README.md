# Oorja
The Oorja: Real-Time Sustainable Power Monitoring System is a revolutionary solution designed to enhance energy efﬁciency in various industries as well as commercial properties. It provides real-time monitoring and analysis of power consumption, enabling businesses and households to optimize their energy usage and reduce costs.

History:
> Originally in version 1 Oorja was designed as an energy measuring device using Bluetooth module and Arduino UNO. It was limited in range and the sensor it used was primary and didn't provide accurate readings

> In version 2 Oorja was upgraded to use ESP32 instead of Arduino and used a better PZEM-004T sensor which is better, more accurate and energy efficient. It is no longer limited in range as it is IOT enabled.

Progress:
> Currently, Oorja is in its Third version of making. I am trying to integrate AI in its core feature using EmbeddeML in order to enable Oorja to provide personalised suggestions to save energy when it recognises your pattern using its metering capabilities and other sensors which senses the environment around it.
