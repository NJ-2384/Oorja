# Version 3 (The SIH)

The version 3 of Oorja is still under progress. The main advancement of v3 over v2 will be the integration of AI. 

The v2 of Oorja generates a lot of RAW data, and AI thrives on it. Right now in its current state, we can only visualise our consumption and have to optimise ourselves. But my goal with v3 and AI is to generate "Trend" curve with the data it generate and provide optimisation techniques using Embedded Machine Learning algorithms.
